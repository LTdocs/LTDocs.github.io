For example, enter the manufacturer followed by the last four digits of the MAC address: Arris-FD92 BTS Displays the BTS short name, a 14-character code starting with the country code. See Equipment Naming Conventions . Equipment Naming Conventions Customer Displays the name of the customer assigned to the modem. If the modem is not assigned, the field is blank. Status Indicates a possible issue with the RF signal between the modem and the BTS. If the status is green, the modem is communicating normally with the CMTS. If the status is red, the modem cannot connect to the CMTS due to an external issue with the RF signal. SNR Signal-to-noise ratio at the downstream modem (in dB). Use to troubleshoot the downstream signal. For example: at 21 dB the modem is barely connecting; at 27 dB the signal quality is good. DS Pwr Displays the power of the downstream signal measured at the modem (in dBmV). SNR CMTS Displays the signal-to-noise ratio at the CMTS. Use to troubleshooting the upstream signal.

If one or more modems are offline for any reason, the status changes to orange. If all modems are offline, the status changes to red. Performance history graphs Downstream Load A real time graph showing the trend over time of peak data usage for a specific BTS. The x-axis represents the load percentage. The y-axis represents time. Click the magnifying glass to zoom in or out of the graph. Or click and drag your mouse over the time interval you want to examine in more detail. To reset the graph, click zoom out. DS SNR SNR is an indicator of signal quality. It compares a desired signal to the level of background noise. Ideally, you want to have at least NUMBER . The graph displays the average downstream SNR of all channels on all modems and lets you see long term SNR trends, going up or down, and short term changes. For example, if BTS connections are degrading over time, the SNR ratio for the BTS will descrease, measuring less signal and more noise. Modem DS Displays the average downstream power in dBmV at the modem over time. For example, a graph showing a declining trend, tells you that the downstream signal at the modem is weakening, suggesting a problem in the downstream connection from the BTS. CMTS US Displays the average upstream power in dBmV at the BTS. The CMTS in the BTS connects the modems in the network to the backhaul service. Total System US Channel Bandwidth Displays the bandwidth in MHz of up to four upstream bonded channels. On the upstream link between the modem, the BTS, and the backhaul service, tup to 4 channels can bond at one time. When a channel drops, you can see a dramatic degradation in signal very quickly from the BTS. If there are environmental changes affecting the upstream channel, you can see intermittent changes. The changes vary depending on the number of modems. Modem fields Modem Name Displays a modem name entered manually into the modem inventory. Use any consistent naming convention. For example, enter the manufacturer followed by the last four digits of the MAC address: Arris-FD92 BTS Displays the BTS short name, a 14-character code starting with the country code.

SNR Signal-to-noise ratio at the downstream modem (in dB). A measure of signal quality taken from one of the two channels (both channels are the same size). For example: at 21 dB the modem is barely connecting; at 27 dB the signal quality is good. DS Pwr Displays the power of the downstream signal measured at the modem (in dBmV). SNR CMTS Displays the signal-to-noise ratio at the CMTS. Used for troubleshooting the upstream signal. US Pwr CMTS Displays the power of the upstream signal measured at the CMTS (in dBmV).

For example: by neighbourhood, school, or region. The service areas are not pre-defined. Address Physicall address location. City The customer's city or town. Plan Service plan the customer subscribes to. Bandwidth US\/Limit Displays the customer’s real-time upstream data usage and the data cap. If the customer exceeds their limit or data cap, a yellow warning icon appears beside the value. Note there is no automatic suspension or throttling back of service. Bandwidth DS\/Limit Displays the customer’s real-time downstream data usage and the data cap. If the customer exceeds their limit or data cap, a yellow warning icon appears beside the value.
